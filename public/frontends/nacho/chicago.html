        <h1>Spain's 2016 elections and Chicago expenses</h1>
    </a>
    <h4>In this chart I combine my data source, Spain's 1016 elections results and data from the City of Chicago. In that data what I got is information
    about the expenses in certain placesa around the city. For example, AVE stands for AVENUE, so its bar indicates the amount expended on avenues deals and issues in Chicago during the last year.
    Pay attention to the huge difference from that expense to the one in parkways (PW). Note that these Chicago expenses are divided by 100 so that parties seats can be seen on the chart.</h4>
